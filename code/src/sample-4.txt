Subject: Loan Payoff Request - Auto Loan 5678901234

Dear [Bank Name],

I am writing to request the payoff amount for my auto loan, account number 5678901234. I intend to pay off the remaining balance in full within the next two weeks.

Could you please provide me with the exact amount required to close the loan, including any applicable fees or interest accrued up to the payoff date? I would also appreciate instructions on how to make the payment.

Additionally, please let me know what documentation I will receive after the loan is paid off, confirming that the lien has been released.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
