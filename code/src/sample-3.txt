Dear [Bank Name],

I am writing to request a modification to my mortgage loan payment schedule, account number 9876543210. Due to unexpected medical expenses, my current financial situation has changed significantly.

I am finding it increasingly difficult to meet the current monthly payment of $1800. I would like to explore options for reducing my monthly payment, even if it means extending the loan term.

Could you please provide information on possible payment adjustment plans, including any associated fees or interest rate changes? I am hoping to find a solution that allows me to continue making payments without defaulting on the loan.

I am available to discuss this matter at your earliest convenience.

Thank you for your understanding.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
